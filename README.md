# SortAY
SortAY is an all in 1 asset management platform that showcases all your assets in one place and makes managing them easy.

## Usage
Upon opening the app, you are greeted with two options: either browse asset classes as a guest and login via MetaMask and look at your own asset distribution.

###### Guest Login
Upon choosing this method, we can click upon any of the 4 asset classses supported by the app and can browse any of them in detail.

###### Login
in this, the user is asked to link their MetaMask wallet with the app. On doing so, a page opens where the user can see all of their asset distribution in the form of a neat pie chart and can have a look at any one of them in detail by clicking on the buttons below.
They also have the option to buy even more assets in the app.

All this is based on the concept of minimilasm and gives the users a one stop solution to manage their investments.
